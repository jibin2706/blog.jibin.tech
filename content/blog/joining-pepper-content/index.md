Hello friends, I have an exciting announcement! I will be joining Pepper Content as a Frontend Developer. Pepper is an Indian startup committed to building Indian's largest content marketplace. I really liked the vision of what they want to achieve and working with a bunch of young people who started the company and are the same age as mine.
