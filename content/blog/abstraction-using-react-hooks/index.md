React hooks was released with react 16.18.0 version and its been more than 1 year. I was very skeptical around using useEffect rather than traditional lifecycle components, it felt that we are taking a step back. But after using it a while, then I realized how these hooks made a lot of sense.

A big plus point of react hooks is that you get more readable code and can create you own custom hooks and use it in many other components.
