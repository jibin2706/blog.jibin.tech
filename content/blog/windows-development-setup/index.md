I primary use Windows 10 pc for personal projects & setting up development environment is very dreadful in windows but recently with the inclusion of running linux inside windows have made it very easy.

## Getting Started

Even if your laptop comes with windows 10 built in, I recommend removing all the bloatware that comes with the software. You can clean install by grabing ..... if you are up for it. After installing install all the updates if there are any from the settings.
