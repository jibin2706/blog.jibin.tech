Default HTML5 video player looks boring but you can style quickly using some javascript & some elements to replace the default video controls.

In this post I will be using Vue.js to trigger the events but the same can be done with vanilla js or any other fancy framework.

- Removing html5 controls

- Placing custom elements

- Custom progress bar

- Connecting js event handlers (play pause loading)

- Example to show how to do it with vanilla js
